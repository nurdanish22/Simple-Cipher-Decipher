# Simple-Cipher-Decipher
1. Develop strings cipher to cipher any given strings from readable to text to non
readable text.
2. The application requires:
i. A complete UML Class diagram to represent the application.
ii. A menu for the user to select whether to perform cipher or decipher. For cipher an input from user is needed and for decipher a ciphered string is needed. In other words, decipher cannot perform without performing cipher first.
iii. A Class dedicated for the cipher and decipher operations including data fields and methods (setters and getters).
iv. A test or main class to test or execute the methods (setters and getters).
3. String cipher and decipher requirements:
a. Only strings (A-Z or a-z) are considered valid and allowed for cipher and decipher.
b. Numbers and symbols are considered invalid for cipher and decipher.
c. The cipher uses letter/alphabet position substitutition mechanism. For example, if a if found then replace with b,
if b is found replace with c and so on. If z is found replace with a.
d. The decipher will return the position of the letter/alphabet back to its original position.
e. The application must retain the uppercase and lowercase of the strings entered by the user.

Note: Use a StringBuilder class methods to perform the cipher and decipher operations for the input strings.
